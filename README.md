#PCA

Principal component analysis, or PCA, is a dimensionality reduction technique that is practically used universally to analyze large biological data sets, as well as other complex data. Put simply, PCA simplifies a complex set of data, allowing it to be more easily visualized and analyzed. It does this at the expense of accuracy, usually however, the benefits far outweigh the costs. PCA will save you time, both with understanding your data, as well as the time it takes computing various analyses.
